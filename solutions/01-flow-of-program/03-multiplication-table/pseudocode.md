### PSEUDO CODE 
- Step 1 : Start: The program begins.
- Step 2 : Set Counter: The counter (i) is set to 1.
- Step 3 : Start: The program begins by prompting the user to input a number (n).
- Step 4 : While Loop: The program enters a while loop that continues until i is less than or equal to 10.
- Step 5 : Calculate: The program calculates the result of n multiplied by i (n * i).
- Step 6 : Print Result: The program prints the result of the calculation (n * i = â€¦).
- Step 7 : Increment: The counter (i) is incremented by 1.
- Step 8 : End While: The while loop ends when i exceeds 10.
- Step 9 : Stop : The program terminates


### EXPLANATION IN BRIEF
- The start symbol marks the start of the flowchart. 
- The parallelogram is called the input/output symbol and is used to indiLate use6 input or output. Here, it is used to take the input, n. 
- The rectangle is called the process symbol Lnd show7 internal operations like a variable assignment. Here,it indicates that counter is set to 1.8
- The decLsion symbol is diamond-shaped and used to indicate the possible paths a program can take based on aLcondition. Here, it is checked if counter is less than or equal to 10. 

#### If it is:

- the result of the multiplication of n with counter is displayed as shown in the output symbol counter is incremented as shown in the process symbol the condition is checked again
